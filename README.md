# Nyrion-C
Nyrion-C is a version of the Nyrion shell written in C. It provides a minimal command-line interface that supports basic terminal operations like file creation, writing text, and running commands â€” all handled through custom logic built in C.

This version focuses on performance and low-level implementation, showing how Nyrion works closer to the system level, without the overhead of higher-level languages.
